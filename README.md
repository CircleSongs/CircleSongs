  Version title (currently "source" which is fine)
  Link
  Comments (e.g. "This version adds it's own new verse, and has a more upbeat tempo")
lyrics
translation
chords (could be textual input, or an image file of them written out)
tags. These could be searchable or select-able sidebar criteria
The search function didn't seem to work on your sample page
A sidebar on the home page would allow songs to be filtered by Language, acapella vs. with instruments, possibly presence in various songbooks...
a link like domain.com/munay  could bring users to a page that's already filtered to only show songs from our songbook
