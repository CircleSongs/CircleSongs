          %h1 Listening Platforms & Honoring the Artists

          %p
            The songs in this library often appear across multiple listening platforms, each with different
            values, capabilities, and relationships to the artists who created them. Below is a brief overview
            of how these platforms differ, why not all songs are available for listening in every location, and
            how listeners can best engage with this music in a spirit of respect and reciprocity.

          %p
            For the best listening experience, we recommend installing the apps for the platforms you use most
            on your phone or primary listening device.

          %h2 SoundCloud

          %p
            SoundCloud allows for easy sharing of recordings that have not been professionally produced. It is
            our primary platform for songs recorded specifically for this site, as it supports quick, accessible
            sharing without requiring expensive production resources. Many of the recordings shared here were
            created expressly to be offered in this way.

          %h2 Bandcamp

          %p
            Bandcamp is a platform dedicated to ensuring that artists are directly compensated for their work.
            When possible, we encourage listeners to purchase songs from composers through Bandcamp or the
            artists’ own websites. At this time, Bandcamp does not offer robust playlist functionality or
            reliable embedding options, which limits our ability to feature full listening experiences directly
            on this site.

          %h2 Spotify, YouTube, and Other Streaming Platforms

          %p
            Platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, and Pandora are widely used and accessible, which
            is why we frequently reference them as listening options on this site. However, these services
            generally provide very little to no financial compensation to artists—averaging approximately
            $0.003 to $0.005 per stream. As a result, musicians must independently fund their recording projects
            and rely on other means for livelihood and sustainability.

          %h2 How to Honor the Artists

          %p
            We offer the following guidelines in the spirit of respect, reciprocity, and right relationship with
            the artists and traditions represented in this library:

          %ol
            %li
              Consider reaching out to artists you enjoy through their websites or social media channels to
              express gratitude for their work.
            %li
              When possible, purchase songs directly from artists via Bandcamp or their personal websites, and
              consider joining their mailing lists to stay informed about live events and offerings.
            %li
              If you plan to perform a song at a ticketed or public event, or if you wish to record a song
              written by another artist, first obtain their express written consent and arrange appropriate
              compensation or royalty agreements.
            %li
              If you are publicly sharing a song written by a living composer with whom you do not have a
              personal relationship, please do not substantially alter lyrics or other core elements of the
              song without the composer’s consent.
            %li
              When singing songs from other cultural traditions, consider offering your respect by devoting real
              time to research the song, composer(s), traditions, and the complexities of those from colonizing
              cultures sharing indigenous art. Also consider engaging in language study and check your
              pronunciations with native speakers. It is a beautiful practice to give verbal thanks to the
              tradition/composer when sharing the songs in public spaces, and when appropriate, acknowledging
              the collective harms those traditions have endured from colonizers or other cultures.
